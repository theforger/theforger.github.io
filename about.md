Hey, my name is Fabio Gomes! I'm currently Lead Developer of Diorama Digital.
This amazing girl at my side is my wife, she's an expert in Shaders and together offer support to a lot of indie studios.

From the last 5 years, my main objective is to join the Game Development Industry in a great way!
I try to keep contact with a lot of great developers to learn more and more, and also I always try to help the guys who need help.

Nowadays, my main expertise is around the Unreal Engine, I'm an administrator of one of the largest Unreal communities in Latin America,
I also organized a lot of official Unreal Engine Meetups, and basically I know almost all the studios that work with Unreal Engine
in Brazil for Games.

Today I have a high proficiency with C++ around the UE API, but I have a very large ability to adapt my knowledge to another engines.

If you need something or want to ask any question, please contact me at:
