Reflection is the ability of a program to inspect its own code (or other associated code) and change at runtime. By default, C++ isnâ€™t capable of that, however Unreal Engine is kind enough and created this ability!

.h
{% highlight cpp %}
public:
	UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = Reflection)
	void ExecuteFunction(FString FunctionToCall);
{% endhighlight %}

.cpp
{% highlight cpp %}
void ABasePlayer::ReflectionSystem(FString FunctionToCall)
{
	UFunction* theFunction = FindFunctionChecked(*FunctionToCall);
	if( theFunction )
	{
		void* local = nullptr;
		FFrame* frame = new FFrame(this, theFunction, local);
		CallFunction(*frame, local, theFunction);
		delete frame;
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
